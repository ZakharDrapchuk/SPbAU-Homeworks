	I have thought about this topic before, and it is not new to me. It is great that this article offers specific ways to protect against websites collecting personal information. 
	Although I did not experience the internet as it was before, I believe that the issue presented is still relevant today. When I first learned that websites collect information about users and sell it to advertisers, I was outraged. I do not believe that it is possible to completely eliminate this problem, but I want users to have worthy alternatives in this hostile network. I will try to use the advice from the article and hope that more people pay attention to this issue.
